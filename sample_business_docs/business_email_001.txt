Subject: Product Launch Update - Critical Timeline Changes
Date: Monday, February 12, 2024 9:45 AM

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide an important update regarding our upcoming product launch for the CloudSync Pro platform.

After extensive discussions with the engineering and QA teams, we've identified several critical issues that need to be addressed before we can proceed with the launch. The security audit revealed vulnerabilities that require immediate attention, and our performance testing shows that we're not meeting the benchmarks we set for enterprise customers.

Key Changes:
1. Launch date moved from March 15 to April 3, 2024
2. Additional security testing phase added (2 weeks)
3. Performance optimization sprint scheduled for Feb 19-Mar 2
4. Marketing campaign postponed accordingly

I understand this delay may impact our Q1 targets, but ensuring a stable and secure product is our top priority. The additional time will allow us to:
- Complete comprehensive security patching
- Optimize database queries for better performance
- Conduct thorough user acceptance testing
- Prepare more robust documentation

Please update your project timelines accordingly. I've scheduled a team meeting for Wednesday, Feb 14 at 10 AM to discuss the revised roadmap and address any concerns.

If you have any questions or need clarification on specific aspects, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Rachel Anderson
